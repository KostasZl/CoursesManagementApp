# CoursesManagementApp
Just a demo video showing a web application for managing courses, students and grades.
Firstly, if we don't have a database we create a new one in MySQL Workbench, if one already exists we drop its tables.
We change the credentials for username and password in the application.properties file in the project so that it matches our local server of SQL.
Then, we take a look at the different packages of the project, its classes, controllers, repositories and the html files.
Lastly, we see how we can add/update/delete courses, students and their grades.
